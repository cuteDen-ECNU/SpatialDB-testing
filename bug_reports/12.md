According to the crash https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/977, the function related to the geometries with EMPTY seems not to be explored by the test suites.
Consider this statement:
```shell
geos/build/bin/geosop -a 'MULTIPOINT((-2 0), EMPTY)' -b ' GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 0),LINESTRING(0 0,1 0))' distance

# Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
According to the following definition, ST_Distance returns the minimum distance between two geometries :
> returns the minimum 2D Cartesian (planar) distance between two geometries

But the result of ST_Distance(a2, a1) is 3, which is not the minimum distance.
Meanwhile,  the result of ST_Distance(a2, a1) is not same as ST_Distance( a1, a2).
So I believe it is a functional issue that the current test suites haven't explored.
