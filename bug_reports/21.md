Consider the following statement:
```sql
SELECT ST_Covers(a1, a2)
FROM ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOLYGON(((1 0,0 1,-1 0,0 -1, 1 0)))')
As a1, 
ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOINT(EMPTY,(0 0)) ')
As a2;
-- actual{f}, expected{t}
```
According to the definition of ST_Cover below and the point of geometry a2 lies inside, geometry a1 covers a2.

> Returns true if every point in Geometry/Geography B lies inside
 
But Postgis doesn't consider the cover relationship which seems a bug.
