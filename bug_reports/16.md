Consider this statement:
```
SELECT ST_Distance(a2, a1), ST_Distance(a1, a2)
FROM ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOINT((-2 0), EMPTY)') As a1
,ST_GeomFromText(' GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 0),LINESTRING(0 0,1 0))') As a2;
--actual{3,2}
--expected{2,2}
```
According to the following definition, ST_Distance returns the minimum distance between two geometries :

> returns the minimum 2D Cartesian (planar) distance between two geometries

Therefore, the result of ST_Distance(a2, a1) should be the same as ST_Distance(a1, a2) which is 2.
However, ST_Distance(a2, a1) returns 3, which seems to be a bug.
