Consider the following statement:
```sql
SELECT ST_Within(a1, a2), ST_Within(a1, a3)
FROM ST_GeomFromText('POINT(0 0)') As a1
, ST_GeomFromText('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 0), LINESTRING(0 0, 1 0))') As a2
, ST_GeomFromText('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(LINESTRING(0 0, 1 0), POINT(0 0))') As a3;
--expected{t, t}, actual{f, t}
```
According to the definition of ST_Within and interior of POINT,  geometry a1 is within a2
> ST_Within(A, B) ⇔ (A ⋂ B = A) ∧ (Int(A) ⋂ Int(B) ≠ ∅)
For POINTs, the interior is the point itself. 

If the `POINT(0 0)` is behind `LINESTRING(0 0, 1 0)` (such as a3), Postgis gives the correct answer for ST_Within(a1, a3).
When the `POINT(0 0)` is in front of `LINESTRING(0 0, 1 0)` that is shown in a2, Postgis doesn't consider the 'Within' relationship.

ST_With(a1,a2) and ST_Within (a1, a2) give different results while the only difference between a2 and a3 is the order of the linestring and the point. It makes me believe it is a functional issue.
