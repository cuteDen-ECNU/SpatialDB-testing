Consider the following statements:
```sql
SET @g1 = ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((445 614,26 30,30 80,445 614))');
SET @g2 = ST_GeomFromText('MULTIPOLYGON(((445 614,26 30,30 80,445 614)),((1010 190,90 40,40 90,1010 190)))');

SELECT ST_Overlaps(@g2, @g1);
--expected{0}; actual{1}
```
According to the definition of ST_Overlaps:
> Two geometries spatially overlap if they intersect and their intersection results in a geometry of the same dimension but not equal to either of the given geometries.

`@g1` does not overlap `@g2` because the intersection of `@g1` and `@g2` is equal to `@g1`which violates "neither one covers the other".
