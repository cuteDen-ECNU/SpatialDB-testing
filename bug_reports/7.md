Consider the following code:
```sql
DECLARE @g1 geometry;  
DECLARE @g2 geometry;  
SET @g1 = geometry::STGeomFromText (
    'POINT (4 4)',0);
SET @g2 = geometry::STGeomFromText (
    'LINESTRING (0 0, 1 1, 0 1, 1 0)',0);
   
SELECT @g2.STEquals(@g2.STDifference(@g1));
-- expected{1}, actual{0}
 ```
The g2 differenced by g1 that is not related to g2 needs to be equal to g2. Because the relationship between g1 and g2 is disjoint.
But SQLServer doesn't consider that they are equal.
