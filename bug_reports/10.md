Consider the following statement
```sql
SELECT ST_3DDistance(b1, b2)  
FROM ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING Z (0 0 0, 1 0 0)') As b1,
ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING Z (0 0 0, 1 1 1)') As b2;
--  st_3ddistance 
---------------
--              
-- (1 row)
```
1. The ST_3DDistance function is expected to give the result but it doesn't.
2. It seems ST_3DDistance has an impact on other functions, such as ST_3DDWithin. 
  ```sql
  SELECT ST_3DDWithin(b1, b2, 100000)  
  FROM ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING Z (0 0 0, 1 0 0)') As b1,
  ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING Z (0 0 0, 1 1 1)') As b2;
  --expected{t}, actual{f}
  ```
The distance between two geometries is 0, so the 3DDWithin should return true due to the definition:
>Returns true if the 3D distance between two geometry values is no larger than distance distance_of_srid.
