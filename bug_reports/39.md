Consider the following statement:
```sql
SELECT ST_Crosses(g1, g2), ST_Crosses(g1, g3)
FROM (SELECT 
ST_GeomFromText('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (7 1), LINESTRING (6 5, 6 4))') As g1,
ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((7 1, 1 3, 3 9, 7 1))') As g2,
ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((1 3, 3 9, 7 1, 1 3))') As g3
) As sub;
-- actual {true, false}; expected {false, false}
```
It is noticed that g2 and g3 present the same polygon with different order, while ST_Crosses(g1, g2) and ST_Crosses(g1, g3) give different results, which seems like a bug.

The result of ST_Crosses(g1, g2) is expected to be false because there is no interior intersection, according to the definition:

> ST_Crosses(A, B) ⇔ (dim( Int(A) ⋂ Int(B) ) < max( dim( Int(A) ), dim( Int(B) ) )) ∧ (A ⋂ B ≠ A) ∧ (A ⋂ B ≠ B)

It can be reproduced by:
```shell
bin/geosop -a "GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (7 1), LINESTRING (6 5, 6 4))" -b "POLYGON ((7 1, 1 3,  3 9,  7 1))" crosses
# actual{true}; expected{false}
```
