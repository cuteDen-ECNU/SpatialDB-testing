# ****Potential bug in the ST_Equals function.****
27/9/2023
# Geometry Description

The distance from `Point c` ('POINT( 0.2 0.9)') to `Line a` ('LINESTRING(2 0, 0 1)') is 0. `Line b` ('LINESTRING(2 0, 0.2 0.9, 0 1)') is `Line a` plus `Point c`. 

```sql
SELECT ST_Equals(Foo.a, Foo.b), ST_Distance(Foo.a, Foo.c)
    FROM (SELECT ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(2 0, 0 1)') As a,
    ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(2 0, 0.2 0.9, 0 1)') As b,
    ST_GeomFromText('POINT( 0.2 0.9)') As c) As Foo;
```

# Expected Behavior

`Line a` should equal `Line b`. As the example in the document [[link](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Equals.html)](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Equals.html):

```sql
SELECT ST_Equals(g1, g2) As g1Equalsg2
FROM (SELECT ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10)') As g1,
    ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0, 5 5, 10 10)') As g2) As Foo;
 
g1equalsg2 
------------
 t
(1 row)
```
# Actual Behavior
PostGIS doesn’t think `Line a` equals `Line b`. The following statement is the same as the statement in the geometry description. The result of st_equals is false which means Postgis doesn’t think they are the same line.

```sql
SELECT ST_Equals(Foo.a, Foo.b), ST_Distance(Foo.a, Foo.c)
    FROM (SELECT ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(2 0, 0 1)') As a,
    ST_GeomFromText('LINESTRING(2 0, 0.2 0.9, 0 1)') As b,
    ST_GeomFromText('POINT( 0.2 0.9)') As c) As Foo;

st_equals | st_distance
-----------+-------------
f         |           0
(1 row)
```
# Additional Information

****SQLServer thinks the two LINESTRINGs are equal.****
```sql
DECLARE @g1 geometry;DECLARE @g2 geometry;DECLARE @g3 geometry;
SET @g1 = geometry::STGeomFromText ('LINESTRING(2 0, 0 1)',0);
SET @g2 = geometry::STGeomFromText ('LINESTRING(2 0, 0.2 0.9, 0 1)',0);
SET @g3 = geometry::STGeomFromText ('POINT(0.2 0.9)',0);
SELECT @g1.STEquals(@g2) As g1Equalsg2

g1Equalsg2
----------
         1

(1 rows affected)
```
