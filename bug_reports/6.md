g1 is Polygon and g2 is LineString. Consider the following statements:
```sql
DECLARE @g1 geometry;DECLARE @g2 geometry;
SET @g1 = geometry::STGeomFromText ('POLYGON ((1 1, 2 0, 2 2, 0 2, 1 1))',0);
SET @g2 = geometry::STGeomFromText ('LINESTRING (0 0, 4 4)',0);
When using the STCrosses function, I get the result that g1 doesnâ€™t cross g2:
SELECT @g1.STCrosses(@g2) As result;
--actual{f}, expected{t}
```
We have "int_dim < max(g1_dim, g2_dim)",
and both g1 and g2 contain the interior of them.
So the result of g1 crossing g2 is expected to be true.
